# Graph
This project will be contained graph realization with fixed number of branches. Then visualization of graph will be added. And in the end the game of life based on this graph will be created.

Ideas:
  QVector<> for branches
  make graph_t child of QObject (including inheritance hierarchy)
  template for contents of graph
  functions for creating branches
  save and load graph
  class of town (graph oriented)
  save and load towns
  visualization
